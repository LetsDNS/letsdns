Contributing
============

**Submitting and discussing ideas is welcome**

LetsDNS does not provide a dedicated mailing list yet, and if one will ever become necessary depends on the amount of
interest and traffic generated by this project. For the time being, please consider subscribing to the `dane-users`_
mailing list. If you want to submit new ideas, please also check the project's GitHub `discussions`_ and `issues`_
sections, including previously closed issues.

.. _dane-users: https://mail.sys4.de/mailman/listinfo/dane-users
.. _discussions: https://github.com/LetsDNS/letsdns/discussions
.. _issues: https://github.com/LetsDNS/letsdns/issues

**Please do not submit code yet**

LetsDNS is in its early stages and I do not accept any code or documentation contributions at this time. When the
project has matured enough, I will announce the conditions for contributing. Until then, please do not submit any Git
pull requests.

Thank you for your patience.
