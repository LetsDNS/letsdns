Contributing
============

**Submitting and discussing ideas is welcome**

LetsDNS does not provide a dedicated mailing list yet, and if one will ever become necessary depends on the amount of
interest and traffic generated by this project. For the time being, please consider subscribing to the `dane-users`_
mailing list. If you want to submit new ideas, please also check the project's GitHub `discussions`_ and `issues`_
sections, including previously closed issues.

**Submitting contributions**

I do not accept any code or documentation contributions which have not been previously agreed upon. This means opening
an issue or discussion topic first, having a conversation about the matter at hand, and reaching a consensus about both
form and content of the contribution with me. Please do *not* submit any pull requests before I ask for them, as they
will be closed. The outlined, proven practice will save time for all involved. See Heather McNamee's blog `article`_
"Always start with an issue" for more information.
