Contributing
============

**Submitting and discussing ideas is welcome**

Thank you for your interest in LetsDNS. If you want to submit new ideas or discuss the subject matter, please always
check both the project's GitHub `discussions`_ and `issues`_ sections first, including previously closed issues. Use
existing discussions/issues if possible, in order to avoid duplicates and scattered content.

.. _discussions: https://github.com/LetsDNS/letsdns/discussions
.. _issues: https://github.com/LetsDNS/letsdns/issues

**Please do not submit code yet**

LetsDNS is in its early stages and I do not accept any code or documentation contributions at this time. When the
project has matured enough, I will announce the conditions for contributing. Until then, please do not submit any Git
pull requests.

Thank you for your patience.
