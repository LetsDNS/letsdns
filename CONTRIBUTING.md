# Contributing

## Submitting and discussing ideas is welcome

Thank you for your interest in LetsDNS. If you want to submit new ideas or discuss the subject matter, please always
check both the project's [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/LetsDNS/letsdns/discussions) and
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/LetsDNS/letsdns/issues) sections first, including previously closed issues. Use
existing discussions/issues if possible, in order to avoid duplicates and scattered content.

## Do not submit merge requests

LetsDNS is in its infancy and I do **not** accept any code or documentation contributions at this time. If and when the
project has matured enough, I will announce the conditions for contributing. Until then, please do not submit any pull
requests, because they will be rejected without discussion. Thank you for your patience.
