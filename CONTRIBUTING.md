# Contributing

## Submitting and discussing ideas is welcome

Thank you for your interest in LetsDNS. If you want to submit new ideas or discuss the subject matter, please always
check the project's [GitHub issues](https://github.com/LetsDNS/letsdns/issues) section first, including previously
closed issues. Use existing issues if possible in order to avoid duplicates. If there is no issue for a particular
topic, create a new one, and use links to refer to existing issues if you can.

## Do not open merge requests

LetsDNS is in its infancy and I do **not** accept any code or documentation contributions at this time. If and when the
project has matured enough, I will announce the conditions for contributing. Until then, please do not submit any pull
requests, because they will be rejected without discussion. Thank you for your patience.
